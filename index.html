                <p>Hi there, I'm a recent English graduate from the University of Bristol, now working as an account strategist at Google. I have mentored students to
                    access their dream jobs and pursue early career paths, and I currently sit on the youth board for a non-profit called 
                    Hullo which was launched during the first lockdown to address social isolation. I love sports - I am interested in the ways 
                    top sportsmen are motivated to achieve what they achieve - and I am a big consumer of media, from podcasts to books. I also play chess
                    and occasionally review films.</td>
